Hydra is a command-line tool to guess valid pairs of usernames and passwords. Hydra is a powerful tool for brute-forcing passwords of various network services. It can perform fast and parallel dictionary attacks against more than 50 protocols. It is easy to install and use and has many options and features to help you customize and optimize your attacks. If u used Kali Linux, this tool is already installed on your Kali, so just update that version.
